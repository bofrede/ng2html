Thanks to the following people for their feedback:

  Brian Dukes <brian@crox.demon.co.uk> did a lot of testing for me
  with Dos and with his help I managed to track down a problem with
  the ReadLong() function. If you are using a Dos compiler to produce
  16bit code then make sure you uncomment the "#define
  _16_BIT_COMPLIER_" line near the top of the source.

  Steve Pribut <pribut@clark.net> reported that it compiles fine with
  Microsoft C++ 4.1.

  Rick Ratayczak <rickr@execpc.com> pointed out that ng2html was
  producing some bad HTML in one or two places. Thanks to his
  observation the output should be a lot cleaner now.
