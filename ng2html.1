.SH NAME
ng2html \- Norton Guide to HTML Document Converter.
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBng2html\fP guide-path
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBng2html\fP allows you to take a Norton Guide database file and convert
it into a number of HTML documents. This will then allow you to view the
contents of the guide with the Web browser of your choice.

When run against a guide \fBng2html\fP will generate a number of files
(depending on the size of the guide this could be a lot of files) each
containing a page from the guide. All links are generated by \fBng2html\fP
so you don't need to worry about that.

Note that by default the format of the name of the files, apart from the
menu and about details, is "ng%lx.html" (you can change this in the
source if you so desire) which means that on systems where you are
restricted in the number of characters this restriction will affect the
size of a guide you can process. On systems that use FAT (Dos or OS/2
for example) you will run out of names if the guide is more than 0xFFFFFF
bytes (around 16 megs) in size. This should not be a problem for most
people. If it is, use VFAT or HPFS and a compiler that can handle long
file names instead. :-)
.SS OPTIONS
.TP
\fIguide-path\fP
This is the path and name of the Norton Guide to be converted.
.SS CONFIGURATION FILE
You can customise the way ng2html works by using a configuration file.
The name and location of the configuration file depends on what you
set it to in the source. Look for the line that defines \fBCONFIG_FILE\fP.

Valid options are:
.TP
.B BODY=\fIbody-details\fP
If this option is used in the configuration file then the text after the
'=' is used in any generated HTML document as the <BODY> token. One
obvious use for this would be to allow for images as part of the background.
If you do use this option, ensure that what you provide is valid HTML,
ng2html makes no checks.
.TP
.B FRAMES=\fIyes|no|1|0\fP
If set to "yes" (a simple Y, y or 1 will do, everything else is ignored)
this option tells ng2html to generate frames aware HTML. When used, the
code will create two frames, the left hand side displaying the Norton
Guide menu and the right hand side displaying the contents of the
pages.
.TP
.B FRAMECOLS=\fIcols-spec\fP
If framed HTML code is being generated then this option can be used to
specify the FRAMECOLS for the frames. By default this is set to 30%,70%.
You can change this using this config option.

.SH BUGS
The conversion of box drawing characters and other "graphic" charcters that
so many guides rely on could be improved.

Because, depending on the guide, so many small files can be generated,
on some filesystems the resulting HTML can be a waste of diskspace.
